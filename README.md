# mars_core

MARS (Machina Arte Robotum Simulans) is a cross-platform simulation and visualisation tool created for robotics research developed at the [Robotics Innovation Center of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI-RIC)](http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html) and the [University of Bremen](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/robotik/index_en.php).
MARS is designed in a modular manner and can be used very flexibly, e.g. by running the physics simulation without visualization and GUI.
It is possible to extend MARS writing your own plugins and many plugins introducing various functionality such as HUDs or custom ground reaction forces already exist - and it's easy to write your own.

This package provides some core classes managing the simulation itself and providing the main event loop.

## Todo / Notes:
  - envire_smurf_loader dependency is only required for the geometry_namespace string -> maybe move geometry_namespace to envire_types
